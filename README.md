# Lymphocytosis MIL
Academic project

# How to run code?
To run training and testing, just download the `train_test.ipynb` notebook and open it with Google Colab. In the notebook, we first download the data, then we run training and testing.

# Roadmap
- [ ] look what it gives for topk=1 & for topk>1 + aggragation = 'max' (i.e. let the top-1 instance decide for the whole bag, but allow to have more than 1 positive instance in the whole bag)
- [ ] find best configuration possible using topk
- [ ] try taking bottom-k images into considerarion
- [ ] creat a .gif of probabilities distribution over epochs
